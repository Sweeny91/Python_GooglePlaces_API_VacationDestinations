What's the weather like near the equator?
This project utilizes OpenWeather API and google maps in order to answer just that question!

Overview:
OpenWaether API calls were used to provide weather data for randomly generated cities.
This data included: location, temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed.
Once collected and stored in a csv, the csv was them inmported into a pandas data frame for analysis.
The analysis of this dataframe produced a variety of graphical comparisons of these wather conditions and were exported to png images.

Deliverables:
The images and csv files mentioned above can be found in the "output_data" folder of this respository.
The completed jupyter notebook files can be found in the "starter_code" folder of this repository
